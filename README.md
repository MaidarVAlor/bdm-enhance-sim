# BDM Enhancement Simulator
### welcome!
made by Mahvay (or "Mva" if you like the shorter word), welcome to this program's GitHub page.

the "BDM Enhancement Simulator" is a program that simulates Black Desert Mobile's enhancement system.

### features
* enhancement at chosen rate (configured at the beginning)
* enhancement at chosen rate, reset on failure (configured at the beginning)
* chaos gear enhancement
* awakened Mystical/Abyssal/Primal gear enhancement
* relic enhancement
* chaos alchemy stone enhancement
* soul stone enhancement
* Primal/Chaos/Eternal accessory enhancement
* rift totem enhancement

### "maybe" type updates
* add "success rate boost" parameter in case where the user wants to use items that boost the rate. that would require a huge rewrite of some functions...

## trivia
1. I made this for the sole purpose of checking how much of "reverse RNG" debuff I had when I failed level 310 rift stone 5 times *AT 90% RATE*. I also had nothing interesting to do so I started making this spaghetti code.
2. file has 613 lines, all of them have PEP8-compliant width and the file's size on disk is 23.4KiB (kibibytes, aka TRUE kilobytes)
